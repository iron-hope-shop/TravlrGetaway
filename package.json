  "description": "Travlr Getaways’ web app uses the MEAN stack. It offers a lively, responsive experience for customers and for admins. The architecture uses MongoDB for flexible data storage. It uses Express.js for robust server-side handling, and Angular.js for a reactive client-side interface. It uses Node.js for a non-blocking, event-driven backend. It supports the complex needs of online booking and management. The customer side provides an easy trip browsing and booking experience. The admin side is a Single-Page Application (SPA) that ensures efficient backend management with few page reloads.",
